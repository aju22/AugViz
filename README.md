# AugViz

A simple, interactive GUI tool to visualize and experiment with image augmentations before using them for model training. This project is designed to efficiently explore different augmentation strategies without having to write and rerun code multiple times.

## Introduction

**AugViz** provides an easy-to-use graphical interface to visualize various augmentations on images in real-time. Augmentations are critical for improving model performance, especially in computer vision tasks. However, fine-tuning these augmentations through code can be time-consuming and tedious. 

AugViz solves this problem by providing a GUI tool where you can easily visualize the effects of different augmentations and adjust their parameters on the fly. This saves time, simplifies the tuning process, and ensures that you start model training with the optimal augmentation settings.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher). Then, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

You can run the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will start a local server, and you can access the application in your web browser by visiting http://localhost:8501.
